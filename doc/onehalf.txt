You can selectively enable or disable specific plugin integrations by
configuring the `integrations` table:

>lua
    require('onehalf').setup({
        integrations = {
            -- Enable only specific integrations
            diffview = true,
            telescope = true,
            treesitter = true,
    
            -- Disable specific integrations
            fzf = false,
            whichkey = false,
        },
    })
<

Only the integrations you want to modify need to be specified. Any integrations
not mentioned will use their default values.
